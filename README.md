## Demo Day

<p>This is my app called Inner Circle, it's what I worked on as my Demo Day project.</p>
<br>
<p>An inclusive app connecting BIPOC individuals with relatable therapistâ€™s who listen. Users create profiles, can search for their preferred professionals, while professionals showcase licenses and accepted insurances. InnerCircle is to help empower BIPOC to find therapists who understand their unique needs. Reviews and recommendations allow users to share experiences and support each other in their local area
